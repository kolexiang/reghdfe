d
d hdfe will partial out a varlist with respect to a set of fixed effects. It will either overwrite the dataset in memory, or generate new variables.
d
d hdfe is the underlying procedure for the reghdfe module, which contains more details about the routine.
d It can be used as a building block for any regression command that wishes to include multiple high-dimensional fixed effects.
dIt is not a package intended for an end user, but for a package developer.
d
d The partialling out is done employing an extension of the methodology of Guimaraes & Portugal (2010), described in detail by Correia (2015, mimeo).
d It generalizes the within transformation thanks to an iterated application of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem.

d For more details, see the Guimaraes & Portugal paper, the help file, or the ancilliary PDF
